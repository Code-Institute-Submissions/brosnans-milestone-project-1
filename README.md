Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for a gym.

The website covers a number of the gyms highlights as a business that covers member testimonials, class timetable schedules and a consultation request form.

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design.

The color scheme was chosen to create an eyecathcing appearance.

For potential new members, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of the gym and how it provides value to its members.

Technologies
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap

Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add some more visually appealing class schedules in the timetables section. My knowledge of javascript is not currently strong enough to implement some features I would have liked.

Testing

THe timetables PDF will open in a new tab for optimum UX.

On the contact page you will be unable to submit the form unless all fields are populated.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/brosnans/milestone-project-1 into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.
