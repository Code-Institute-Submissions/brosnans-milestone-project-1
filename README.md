•	Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for a fictional gym call The Powerhouse Gym. The website advertises a number of the gyms highlights as a business which includes member testimonials, class timetable schedules and a consultation request form for those who wish to have a consultation with an instructor from the gym before deciding to become a member.

The objective of the website design is to make it as easy as possible to navigate and access information about the gym via the website while also achieving a minimalist design. The color scheme achieving an eye catching appearance and is very vibrant. This color scheme relays the message of the energy and vibrancy of the gym to the user.

For potential new members a brief overview of the gym and how it provides value to its current members is offered on the testimonials page. The timetable page offers the user an opportunity to see the range of classes on offer and how the classes are scheduled.



•	UX

The website has been designed for users who are interested in learning more information about the powerhouse gym such as the value it provides for its current members and the schedule of exercise classes which are on offer. There is also a facility on the contact page where the user may arrange a consultation with an instructor from the gym. The objective of the design is to provide information by guiding them through the website and then ultimately to the consultation form so that they can take the next step to becoming a member/ customer of the gym.

Mockups were completed on Microsoft Powerpoint as part of the design process. This allowed the opportunity to visualize the layout of the website and also test the colors used to achieve the highest quality user experience possible. 



•	Features

Navbar – allows the user to navigate the website with ease and access the content they wish to see. The navbar will switch to an intuitive flex display when in mobile view.

Jumbotron – give the user a headline and information about the particular page of the website they are on. This enables them to immediately decide if they are on the page they intended viewing.

Footer – the footer gives the user more information about the mission and objective of the gym. A link to a nice PDF version of the class timetables is also available for download via the “Download” link in the footer. The “Social” section of the footer provides links so the user can access the social media profiles of the gym. This is a very useful source of information for the user and is visually attractive.



•	Additional features to be implemented in the future:

An additional feature which would enhance the user experience would be the facility to pay for membership to the gym via the website.

Also, some more visually appealing class schedules in the timetables section. My knowledge of javascript is not currently strong enough to implement these features.



•	Technologies Used

The core coding languages used to construct this project are HTML and CSS. These are the languages which I have been using to develop projects to date. Both languages are easy to sue and this project allowed me an opportunity to develop my HTML and CSS skills.

The bootstrap framework https://getbootstrap.com/ was used to develop this project. Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.
This easy to use framework allowed me to build a responsive, mobile-first project with an extensive front-end component library.
